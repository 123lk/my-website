<h1>Words of wisdom...</h1>
<ul>
  <li>“Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different;
    enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will);
    being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it won’t).” – James Baraz</li>
  <li>“The moment one gives close attention to anything, even a blade of grass, it becomes a mysterious,
    awesome, indescribably magnificent world in itself.” – Henry Miller</li>
  <li>“Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart.
    Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside, awakens.” – Carl Jung</li>
</ul>
